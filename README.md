# drawcarddemo
A piece of code that implements the lottery logic. Implemented with gdscript.

You can open it directly with godot.

Switching to your own card pool is simple. All you need to do is add your own files to the cards folder and add or remove the contents in the var cards section of the code in the same format. After the card is drawn, you may need an interface to modify your database, and the cards[randomCardId] in the code is the position of the card in the dictionary.

Everyone is welcome to reuse my code. If you have any questions, please contact me.
